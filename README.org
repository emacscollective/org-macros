These are the macros I use in Org files used to author Info manuals.

In ~org-macros.el~ you can find each macro in a human-readable format.

In ~orgconfig~ each macro only uses a single line, as expected by Org.
This file can be copied next to the manual and then imported with
~#+setupfile: .orgconfig~.  One could also just copy individual macros
to the manual file itself.
